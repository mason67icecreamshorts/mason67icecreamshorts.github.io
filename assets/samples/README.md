Sample assets placeholder

This folder is intended for example audio samples you may want to ship with the demo (e.g., kick.wav, snare.wav, hat.wav).

For size reasons this repo does not include big sample packs. To add samples:

1. Put your WAV/MP3 files in `assets/samples/`.
2. In the DAW, for a track use the file input to load a sample from your local disk (or use a direct URL if hosted).

If you want, I can add a tiny set of short, public-domain 1-shot sample files in this folder.
